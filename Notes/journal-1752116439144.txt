So yesterday, i  planned to take position's at resistance but i entered the trade prediction that market might go up, before that i was holding the existing position that caused around 2k loss so to recover that i enter another trade at resistance and today was expiry day so the price consolidated at pivot level then fell down back to resistance level,

what is learnt is be displaned and treate it as business.
