This project is a trading journal app with a React frontend and Node.js backend. Features include a chatbox for journal entries (with image paste support), a side navbar for browsing previous journals, motivational words, and a modern UI. Journals and images are saved in a Notes directory as .txt and image files. The backend provides APIs to save and load journals and images.
